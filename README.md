# JAX Learning
This repository contains self-study project on learning JAX.

- I have several model implementation and training in JAX under `flax_mnist.ipynb` in increasing order of complexity.
- Moreover, an implementation of kmeans using gradient descent (on average inertia) in JAX is available in `jax_kmeans_gd.ipynb`.
